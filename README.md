## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What is the meaning behind the name C#?
- Who is the lead architect of the development team of C#?
- What is .NET?
- What is the difference between C# and .NET?
- How to use VSCode and the integrated terminal to initialize, build, and run C# projects
- How to print text and variables using Console.Write

## Requirements
### Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- All your files must be executable

### C# Tasks

- Allowed editors: ```Visual Studio Code```
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using ```dotnet```
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All default C# files named ```Program.cs``` should be renamed to the name given in each task
- You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project. The default names generated in ```Program.cs``` for ```class``` are okay
- Each C# task requires its own folder and ```.csproj``` file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
- You do not need to push your ```obj/``` or ```bin/``` folders
